          <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan in Holyoke, Massachusetts, volleyball was originally called "Mintonette" and was designed as a gentler alternative to basketball.
The name was changed to "volleyball" in 1900, reflecting the volleying action over the net.
Recognized internationally, volleyball became an Olympic sport in 1964.
Today, volleyball is played worldwide in various forms, including indoor, beach, and sitting volleyball.</p>

          <h2>Rules</h2>
          <p>Volleyball is played by two teams of six players on a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective is to send the ball over the net and ground it on the opponent's side of the court,
          while preventing them from doing the same. Each team can touch the ball up to three times before sending it over the net. Matches are typically played to the best of five sets, with each set played to 25 points,
           requiring a two-point advantage. Common faults include serving out of bounds, illegal hits, touching the net, or crossing the center line. The team that wins three out of five sets wins the match.</p>
